# PixelTreasureMap
PixelTreasureMap generates a random pixelated treasure map using Perlin noise for height map creation. The map includes various terrain types like water, sand, grass, and stone, all displayed in a pixel-art style. The project features a classic "X marks the spot" element, making each map unique and interactive. Created for a p5.js course as part of my master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), it's designed for a fun visual experience.

## Usage
